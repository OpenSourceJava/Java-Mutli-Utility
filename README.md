Java-Mutli-Utility
==================
a Java swing application that will have many other 'embedded' features inside of it basically a tool that has 
a bunch of other tools in it. Feel free to reference and use this code as you like
as long as you follow the rules of the GPL v3, please read the LEGAL.txt for more on this.

The first version of the Java Multi Utility is now available on mediafire for free. Its only in its Alpha state so dont expect much BUT there will be lots more in the future! Note that as of right now i designed this app to work on my monitor
so if your on a smaller monitor or a tablet the application size may be a bit wierd, I will fix this in in the near fututre.
